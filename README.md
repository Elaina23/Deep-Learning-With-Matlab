# Deep-Learning-With-Matlab
This is a deep learning project done on matlab. The class of deep learning neural network used is Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) which has a high accuracy for image classification and recognition. The Classification technique which is a Supervised Learning approach was used to build the model, train the model with train images and later identify and predict the classes of test images. The categories used are recyclable, non-recyclable and organic wastes and the images used for this project were downloaded from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/sapal6/waste-classification-data-v2. Confusion matrix is used as the performance metric for determining the accuracy of the model. The confusion matrix was created for matlab pretrained networks Alexnet and VGG16 and I obtained an accuracy of over 90 percent. The Convolusional Neural Network(CNN) done from scratch would be uploaded soon.
